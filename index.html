            <p>
                Hey! 
            </p>
            <p>
                My name is Hayk. I am a software engineer based in Yerevan.<br>
                I am currently employed at nOps, where I spend my time thinking about cost optimization on Kubernetes.<br>
                I code mainly in Python and sometimes in Go and I often daydream about starting a company.<br>
                I previously worked as a software engineer at a number of other startups.<br>
                Before that, I studied philosophy and religion in Middlebury College, in the scenic state of Vermont. At this time, Heidegger was my favorite philosopher.<br>
                Before Heidegger, I studied in the UWC Pearson College on the Pacific coast.<br>
